# GTAV_Handling_Mixer
Tool to generate handling.meta files from 2 different handling.meta files, performing a interpolation between values of both. Allows per-property fine tuning.

#### With this tool you can quickly tune any handling.meta file, without having to manually set values for every vehicle. Happy modding!

### Features
		- Select two different handling.meta files (vanilla and modded for example) and get a mixed handling.meta with full per property user control:
		- Mix value Factor => Interpotate property
		- Use A => Take value from A handling
		- Use B => Take value from B handling
		- Fixed Value.
		*** Other properties
		- Value Offset
		- Value Multiplier
		- Value custom formula (supporting math expressions) (Doc link TODO)
		- Value minimum
		- Value Maximum

### F.A.Q.
	- Q: I just have one handling file, don't want to mix between two but quickly tune some properties, can this be done?
	- A: Yes, just set A and B handling to the same file, and then play with offset, multiplier, custom formula, min, max
